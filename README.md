# Assignment7 An Exerice in Automated Programming
# Using Jennifer library to automatically generate codes

All codes and previous work are saved in folder Assignment7. When open the Assign7 folder, there are cmd and pkg two folders. I break down previous work into three parts. Keep the main function in the cmd folder. LoadCSV function and plotregression function are separated saved in the pkg folder. This will be easier for me to use these two functions in my other files. In the cmd folder, the original main.go file is saved under main_f folder, and the file I created is called gen_main.go and this file is used to automatically generate codes which has the exact same functions with the main.go file. After running the gen_main.go file, it will create main_gen.go file automatically and run the automatical generated file will get the same results as the main.go file does. 

#AI-assisted Programming
I downloaded the Github Copilot. When I try to write some simple codes or the codes I mentioned above serveral times, the copilot will help me automatically refill and all I have to do is press the enter buttom and this saves me a lot of time. 

#AI-generated code
The LLM-based service I selected is ChatGPT. This is the URL'https://chat.openai.com/'. All the conversation I have uploaded in the text file. 

# Summary 
After experiencing these three ways, I think ChatGPT is the most efficient way to help programmers to reduce the programming workload. It contains all details and explainations when you face to new codes. It will also provides related examples to help users understand more easier. However, there is also a question. In the future work, if we only rely on ChatGPT, we will face the problem of palgiarism. My suggestion is in the beginning, users can rely on ChatGPT to understand the code. When you are creating yours, shut down the ChatGPT and make the extension by your own.
