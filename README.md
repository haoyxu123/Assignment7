# Assignment7 An Exerice in Automated Programming

#Using library Jennifer to automatically generate loadCSV function
I successfully generater the function loacCSV by using Jennifer. I created a file called test_generator.go and after running this, the loadcsv_test.go will be generated successfully. Then I can run this file to read the csv. 

#AI-assisted Programming
I downloaded the Github Copilot. When I try to write some simple codes or the codes I mentioned above serveral times, the copilot will help me automatically refill and all I have to do is press the enter buttom and this saves me a lot of time. 

#AI-generated code
The LLM-based service I selected is ChatGPT. This is the URL'https://chat.openai.com/'. All the conversation I have uploaded in the text file. 

# Summary 
After experiencing these three ways, I think ChatGPT is the most efficient way to help programmers to reduce the programming workload. It contains all details and explainations when you face to new codes. It will also provides related examples to help users understand more easier. However, there is also a question. In the future work, if we only rely on ChatGPT, we will face the problem of palgiarism. My suggestion is in the beginning, users can rely on ChatGPT to understand the code. When you are creating yours, shut down the ChatGPT and make the extension by your own.
